# Final_Project
This is the final project for CSYE7200
We chose to use Spark to scale the data processing. 
The data we use comes from the National Center for Environmental Information of the United States and is well-prepared.
The project runs on spark on cloud mode which  means AWS is needed. 
The resulting processing time was around 30 mins.
